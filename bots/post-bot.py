    **New Voting and Reward System**

    To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:

    1. **Upvoting with Tips:**
       * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts. These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month.
       * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS.
       * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote.
    2. **Weighted Votes:**
       * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance).
       * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0).
       * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight).
    3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**
       * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count.
       * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments.
    4. **Transparency:**
       * Tip records will look like this:

          `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`

    **Guidelines:**

    * Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation.
    * As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially.
    * Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action.

    Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! ðŸš€
