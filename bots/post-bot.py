To promote quality content and reduce spam, we've implemented a new tip-voting system! Here's how it works:
 
1. **Upvoting with Tips:**
   * Use the `!tip` command to upvote comments/posts. These are special upvotes that determine a user's DONUT reward at the end of the month.
   * Example: `!tip 5` to tip 5 DONUTS.
   * Any tip of 1 or more DONUTS counts as 1 vote.
2. **Weighted Votes:**
   * Vote weight is based on your [governance score](https://donut-dashboard.com/#/governance).
   * A governance score of 20K or more has a full vote weight (1.0).
   * Scores below 20K have a proportional weight (e.g., 1K score = 0.05 weight).
3. **Anti-Spam Measures:**
   * Comments with tips below 5 DONUTS and less than 12 characters will be removed, but the vote will still count.
   * All tips are recorded under a stickied comment for transparency, including tips included in removed comments.
4. **Transparency:**
   * Tip records will look like this:
 
      `u/[username] tipped u/[anotheruser] 1.0 DONUT (weight: 0.4) [ARCHIVE](link to snapshot)`
 
**Guidelines:**
 
* Tip votes should be based solely on the quality of the content, not on the author or expectations of reciprocation.
* As a tipper, you are acting as a judge, ensuring that valuable contributions are rewarded impartially.
* Quid pro quo tipping behavior will be penalized. Moderators will monitor tips for misuse and take appropriate action.
 
Let's make EthTrader a better place by contributing valuable content and rewarding it fairly! ðŸš€
